Overall idea: to record audio
    buttons: start_record, stop_record, play_recrding?
    scripts:
        # js
        ? mediarecorder:
            created object
            ? did we use this for the events?
         start_record: 
            click events:
                disabled start_record
                made an empty audiochunk #  something like alist, does audio come in in chunks?
         stop_record : 
            click events:
                ?
                do something with the audio chunk:
                    debugging with printout of where blob is stored
                    set the blob address to the input of the player
                three dot pattern for downloading the audio
                        
         blob ... invoked mediarecorder record:
            - ask for mic permission,
                ".then" in the code
                 else print error
            - "on ready" event: when the audio is ready  
                    some conversion to "wav" --> blob
            ?? the code with the mediaplayer, other functionalities
